# rtos_project

This repository contains the reference project used in the course:

**Advanced Embedded Software with STM32, FreeRTOS & Modbus**

The project demonstrates how to structure and implement an embedded software application using an STM32F446RE microcontroller, FreeRTOS, sensor integration and a custom Modbus RTU stack.

## About the Project

The code in this repository is designed as a **learning and reference project**, focusing on:

- STM32 register-level development using CMSIS
- FreeRTOS task design and synchronization mechanisms
- Interrupt-driven peripheral control (UART, SPI, I2C, DMA, etc.)
- Environmental sensor integration
- FRAM-based data logging
- A modular Modbus RTU slave implementation

The emphasis is on **code structure, clarity, and maintainability**, rather than minimal examples.
